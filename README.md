An article I am writing for [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/us) about [this paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00417) (Rowan et al. 2015, *The Lick-Carnegie Exoplanet Survey: HD32963 -- A New Jupiter Analog Orbiting a Sun-like Star*).

:construction_worker: It's a work in progress, and it will suck for a while. :construction_worker:

# Key points
- The paper asks if Jupiter analogs (planets similar to Jupiter) orbiting Sun-like stars are rare. This is crucial to understanding whether the Solar System is "typical", since much of the Solar System's formation history and architecture was determined by Jupiter. 
- Mr. Rowan's paper determines that only about 3% of all stars host a Jupiter analog, which has important implications for our search for "Earth twins" and life outside the Solar System. 
- It also reports on the discovery of a new Jupiter analog orbiting a star very similar to the Sun, HD 32963 b. Mr. Rowan discovered this planet by analyzing over 16 years of observations taken with the Keck telescope in Hawaii. 
- Finally, this paper shows the importance of training our students in scientific research using real astronomical data, and tools that are accessible enough to be used without formal training (ref. my previous article: https://theconversation.com/telescope-apps-help-amateurs-hunt-for-exoplanets-24925).

# Is the Solar System typical? High school student adds another piece to the puzzle #

Is our little corner of the Galaxy a special place? As of today, we've [discovered more than 1,500 exoplanets](http://exoplanets.org) (planets orbiting stars other than the Sun), with thousands more candidates waiting for confirmation in the pipeline. The figure below (called a *mass-period diagram*) shows the periods and masses of the planets discovered so far, compared with the properties of Solar System planets. A cursory look at the figure shows that planets like the Earth, Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus occupy "empty" parts of the diagram, seemingly indicating that the majority of planetary systems do not resemble our own Solar System. We lack close-in planets (planets with a period smaller than Mercury's), any super-Earths (a common class of planets with masses a few times the mass of the Earth), and we have several long-period gas giants with orbits very close to circular.

*Left: a mass-period diagram. Each dot is a confirmed exoplanet. Right: the planetary system HD 219134. In this system, at least 5 planets orbit so close to the central star that their "years" are only between 3.1 and 94 days long.*

Part of this discrepancy (change) is due to *selection effects*: close-in, massive planets are easier to discover than far-out, low-mass planets. In fact, [a recent paper by Drs. Rebecca Martin and Mario Livio](http://aasnova.org/2015/09/25/how-normal-is-our-solar-system/) argues that the Solar System is overall more typical than previously thought, based on a number of properties. There is a sticking point, however: Jupiter stands out as an outlier, based both on its orbital location (with a period of about 12 years) and its very-close-to-circular orbit.

## Throwing its weight around ##
According to our understanding of how the Solar System formed, Jupiter shaped much of its early history. It influenced the formation of Saturn, clearing out the inner Solar System of debris, and potentially facilitated the development of life by shielding Earth from comets. As a consequence, understanding whether Jupiter is a relatively common planet is crucial to understanding whether *true* Solar Systems are abundant in the Galaxy, and -- by extension -- planets like Earth.

Despite their relative heft, discovering Jupiter analogs (with periods and masses similar to those of Jupiter's) is challenging, since their long orbital periods require monitoring a star for a long time. Jupiter-like planets are typically discovered using an indirect detection method called the radial velocity method. The gravitational pull of a planet on the central star will cause the wavelength of the light we receive to shift towards bluer or redder colors in a distinctive, period pattern. This periodic signal can require the monitoring of a star over many years, or even decades.

## Are Jupiter-like planets rare? ##
In a recent paper, Dominick Rowan, a high-school senior, and his co-authors analyzed data taken at the Keck telescope in Hawaii for more than 1,000 stars. Many of those stars had been monitored for 10 years or more.
