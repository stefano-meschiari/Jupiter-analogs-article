An article I am writing for [The Conversation](https://theconversation.com/us) about [this paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00417) (Rowan et al. 2015, *The Lick-Carnegie Exoplanet Survey: HD32963 -- A New Jupiter Analog Orbiting a Sun-like Star*).

# Key points
- The paper asks if Jupiter analogs (planets similar to Jupiter) orbiting Sun-like stars are rare. This is crucial to understanding whether the Solar System is "typical", since much of the Solar System's formation history and architecture was determined by Jupiter. 
- Mr. Rowan's paper determines that only about 3% of all stars host a Jupiter analog, which has important implications for our search for "Earth twins" and life outside the Solar System. 
- It also reports on the discovery of a new Jupiter analog orbiting a star very similar to the Sun, HD 32963 b. Mr. Rowan discovered this planet by analyzing over 16 years of observations taken with the Keck telescope in Hawaii. 
- Finally, this paper shows the importance of training our students in scientific research using real astronomical data, and tools that are accessible enough to be used without formal training (ref. my previous article: https://theconversation.com/telescope-apps-help-amateurs-hunt-for-exoplanets-24925).
